good opportunity create friendship between new york and genoa and convey message peace bringing together jazz great artist like regina carter who lives new york and paganini cannon concert revenue will the sept fund and doctors without borders the idea jazz musician playing paganini treasure was not universally endorsed genoa musical elite rallied around the institute paganinian studies which condemned the concert the moral ground reported local papers that jazz profanation would debase the image the instrument jan kott used say that order shakespeare well you have betray him and bring out those elements that resonate with today said andrea liberovici composer and founder the experimental theater company teatrodelsuono who was mastermind and producer the event shakespeare truth still speaks not just some period drama the same true with the violin when paganini was alive didn play music from years before convinced that were alive today would play jazz although the violin committee overseers had moral qualms about carter playing the cannon the thought that musician might improvise the instrument something that hadn happened since paganini did himself did give them pause the fact that she had classical training was big relief for said bruce carlson violin maker cremona who one three people responsible for maintaining the instrument some contemporary music uses the instrument ways that are completely different from what was designed for percussion instrument for example carlson the first american appointed the post long line italians the committee concerns included the type shoulder rest chin rest and strings carter would using jazz concerts sounds are sometimes amplified electronically modified carlson said which defeats the purpose using such fine instrument like the cannon wanted acoustic concert said without any microphones pickup she agreed that carter stranger resistance jazz violin when she took master class with yehudi menuhin the center for theater

kind jazz lick carter said say say felt had won classical musicians tend say jazz just some kind noise and jazz musicians say classical music museum music dead she said have commend the mayor and the whole community genoa for allowing this happen musically huge statement you can open borders within art then you can reach past prejudice injustice and racism and maybe have effect mankind get people away from old ways thinking her first encounter with the cannon two hour rehearsal the day before the concert followed strict protocol violin maker carrying the instrument its case walked into the small chamber palazzo tursi where carter was waiting checked the radiator assessed the level humidity the air and ordered additional table brought into the room which laid out red velvet cloth and opened the case handing the instrument carter made nervous carter said felt like schoolgirl before the headmaster one wouldn have guessed from the way the notes rose tersely from the violin and tenderly segued into rendition amazing grace the instrument served her concert performance best when she played slow melodic tunes blues and ballads even without amplification her duet billie holiday
